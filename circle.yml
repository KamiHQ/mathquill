# Okay so maybe everyone else already knows all this, but it took some time
# for Michael and I [Han] to really see how everything fits together.
#
# Basically, what we're doing here is automated browser testing, so CircleCI
# handles the automation, and Sauce Labs handles the browser testing.
# Specifically, Sauce Labs offers a REST API to run tests in browsers in VMs,
# and CircleCI can be configured to listen for git pushes and run local
# servers and call out to REST APIs to test against these local servers.
#
# The flow goes like this:
#   - CircleCI notices/is notified of a git push
#   - they pull and checkout and magically know to install dependencies and shit
#       + https://circleci.com/docs/manually/
#   - their magic works fine for MathQuill's dependencies but to run the tests,
#     it foolishly runs `make test`, what an inconceivable mistake
#   - that's where we come in: `circle.yml` lets us override the test script.
#       + https://circleci.com/docs/configuration/
#   - our `circle.yml` first installs and runs a tunnel to Sauce Labs
#   - and runs `make server`
#   - then it calls out to Sauce Labs' REST API to open a browser that reaches
#     back through the tunnel to access the unit test page on the local server
#       + > Sauce Connect allows you to run a test server within the CircleCI
#         > build container and expose it it (using a URL like `localhost:8080`)
#         > to Sauce Labsâ€™ browsers.
