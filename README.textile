Please note that this is an alpha version, so bugs and unimplemented features are all over the place.

(Powered by jQuery, v1.4+ required. Get it from http://jquery.com.)

All you need is a script include in your header:

@<script src="http://laughinghan.github.com/mathquill/mathquill.js">@

and wherever you'd like to convert LaTeX math to HTML or embed an editable math-textbox:

@<span class="mathquill-embedded-math">[optional LaTeX source]</span>@

Note that for dynamically created elements, you will need to call our jQuery plugin:

@$('<some set of dynamically created elements>').mathquill();@
